BEFORE


How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? 
almost never. Initial try yielded 0/4 results

Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?
No. All three options scored 0/4 when tested.


What is good or bad about this strategy?
This brute force strategy was bad becasuse it is inefficient and can take several iterations before a correct theory is made.




AFTER

How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? 
My program solves the problem in less than 20 guesses everytime its ran




Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?
There is no change reguardless of which choice is selected




What is good or bad about this strategy?
This strategy is good because it will delete any guess that Assistant Jack said is wrong so it will not waste a guess to get an answer that was already shown.
